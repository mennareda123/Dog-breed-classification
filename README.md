#  Dog Breed Classification with ResNet50

This project is a **Computer Vision application** that classifies dog images into **70 different breeds** using **Transfer Learning with ResNet50**.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a **Streamlit app** for deployment.

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mennareda123/Dog-breed-classification.git
   cd Dog-breed-classification
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

##  Dataset
- The dataset consists of **images of 70 dog breeds**.  
- Images are resized to **224Ã—224** before feeding into the model.  
- Data is split into **training, validation, and test sets**.

---

##  Model
- **Base Model:** ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)  
- **Architecture Modifications:**  
  - Global Average Pooling  
  - Dense(256, ReLU) + Dropout(0.5)  
  - Softmax output for 70 classes  

---

##  Results
- Training & validation accuracy plotted during training.
- Final accuracy: **~XX%** (replace with your actual result).
- Confusion matrix & classification report included in notebooks.

---

## ðŸŽ® Usage

### Run the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run App.py
```

1. Upload a dog image.
2. The model predicts the **breed** with probability score.
